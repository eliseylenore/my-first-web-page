    <h1>About Ozlow</h1>
    <p>
      Ozlow is an orange tabby with a bunch of other stuff.  We got him from the shelter the same day we got his adopted sister Finly, and he immediately got sick with a sinus infection and 2 different stomach parasites.  He now has a wheezy pur because of it, and sounds like a floppy disc writing when he gets really excited.  He resembles closely a mountain lion, because he has a long face, a super long tail, and enormous paws.
