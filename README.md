## Description

_The application is a series of webpages connected by a Home Page. The first webpage is a list of favorite things, including photos of favorite people. The second webpage is My first webpage, and describes what we will learn about coding in this course. The last three webpages are blog pages on our cats._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone this repository_

## Known Bugs

_We did not add images for the favorite people, so those show up as broken links._

## Technologies Used
