    <h1>Finly is crazy</h1>
    <p>Finly is an extremely noisy cat, who will stand inside of the shower and <strong>scream at you</strong>, I'm assuming out of fear for you of the water. It's probably the most annoying part of her personality, but it's also always hilarious.</p>

    <h2>Things Finly likes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Not being pet but asking for pets</li>
      <li>Crying</li>
      <li><em>Her shoe string</em></li>
    </ul>
